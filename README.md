Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. This involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
The software development life cycle involves the finding out and documentation of the users' needs and system requirement.
After that, high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and UI are created.
Afterwards, the code is written to build the software according to the design specifications.
Thereafter, the software is tested to ensure it meets the needed standards and requirements.
The softare is released to users after these, and regular support, maintenance, and update is done on the software.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
The Agile model focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and response to change by using an iterative and incremental approach.
The Waterfall model, on the other hand, uses a sequential approach, and it has distinct phases that flow downwards like a waterfall. Hence, the name.
The agile model might be preferred in startups, or in situations whereby the software is needed on tight deadlines with a team that has little to no bureaucracy. However, the Waterfall model can be used in established teams with a laid-down structure and various team members with defined managerial functions.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Requirements Engineering has to do with the definition, documentation, and maintenance of the requirments in the software development lifecycle.
It includes a feasibility study to check if the project is feasible considering the technical, economic, legal, and operational aspects plus the schedule.
Information is then gathered to check what stakeholders need from the project.
Afterwards, Software Requirement Specification is done, which then leads to Software Requirement Validation. 
RE is important because it helps provide clear guidance on the project, and all parties can come to an agreement on whether they understand one another before the software development begins.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Modularity has to do with the splitting of the software design in a way that allows the software to be maintainable and scalable, as the parts can be developed and maintained separately, while they can all work together when assembled.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Testing helps to check that the software meets the specifications and is free from errors.
Unit testing checks the individual units in the software, and this is done by the developers.
Integration testing checks if the units of the software integrate properly, and this is done by developers and testers.
System testing has to do with testing the software as a whole to check if the final output meets the goals.
Acceptance testing is done by customers and end-users to check if they are satisfied by the software and if it meets their requirements.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
Version Control Systems are software tools that help track changes to source code. They are important as they help coordinate work among team members. Some popular ones include Git and Subversion. They give the ability to commit, push, pull, and update code.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
A software project manager helps plan and supervise the software project lifecycle. This includes the management of resources, risk, quality, and communication to ensure a successful project execution. The manager is involved in the planning process and helps define deliverables and develop a schedule for the project in accordance with the budget.
They sometimes face challenges that include changing requirements, tight deadlines, and technical debt.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
Software maintenance us the process of modifying and updating a software for enhancement after it has been delivered to the customer.
Some of the activities inlcude bug fixing to find and fix errors in the software, enhancements to add or improve existing features, performance optimization for speed efficiency and reliability, and re-engineering to improve the design and architecture for maintenance and scalability.
It is an essential part of the software lifecycle as it provides correction for faults, and can help with the improvement of the design and the interfacing with other systems.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Some ethical issues software engineers might face include algorithm bias, addictive design, corporate ownership of personal data, weak cybersecurity and personal identifiable information protection, and overemphasis on features. 
Software engineers can ensure adherence to ethical standards by focusing on personal data access and retention, data access controls, and creating a functional, user-friendly product.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
